# Switch to Blogdown


In 2022, my goal is to post more content here, so it felt appropriate to give my website a facelift. This new site is built in [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), a package used to create websites in RMarkdown. My previous website was built with Jekyll around two years ago, and I didn't put much time into designing the site or understanding how to best use Jekyll. Re-starting with the Blogdown framework gave me an opportunity to start from scratch and build something I am proud of.

There are a few things about blogdown I really like:
1. It's built for R users and super intuitive if you are coming from an R background
2. [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/). It's super easy to create a good looking site without getting caught up in details.
3. Works well with github pages, where my site is currently hosted

**TLDR;** blogdown is awesome, I highly recommend to anyone wanting to build a new website!
